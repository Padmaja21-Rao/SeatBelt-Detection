Overview

This project uses Python and OpenCV (and optionally a pre-trained model) to identify whether a person inside a vehicle is wearing a seat belt.
It loads an image, performs detection, and displays or saves the processed image.

*** What this project does

Loads an input image

Applies seat belt detection

Displays detection results in the terminal

Saves the output image with bounding boxes and labels

Simple, lightweight implementation



*****Requirements

Install required packages:

pip install opencv-python numpy


******How to Run

Run the detection script:

python seatbeltdetect.py


*****After running, you will get:

detected_image.png → processed output

Terminal output
